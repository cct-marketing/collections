Library to handle collections in PHP.

The idea of the project is centralize some already existent libraries commonly used to handle arrays in the concept of "objects".  

This library is inspired by a couple of some popular collections libraries, such as:

* [Doctrine collections](https://github.com/doctrine/collections)
* [Symfony - Parameter Bag](https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation/blob/master/ParameterBag.php)
* [Laravel collections](https://github.com/illuminate/support/blob/master/Collection.php)
